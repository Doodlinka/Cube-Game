# Cube-Game
#### What is this
This poorly named thing is like a 3D dungeon crawler roguelite featuring:
- 4 randomly generated levels + a boss level
- 4 regular enemies and 2 bosses (4 AI types)
- unnecessary, basic minimap
- a save system using playerprefs
- permanent upgrades
- explosives

#### How to play
CONTROLS:
- W, A, S, D, Shift and Space to move
- E to interact with objects
- F to place or remove markers
- M to toggle minimap
- G to toggle godmode
- Esc to pause
- LMB to shoot
Start in the menu scene, press play, and appear at level 1 unless you have a saved run. Your health and level will be
displayed at the top. Go through doors, shoot enemies to not die, use markers and the minimap if you need to mark something
(but you probably won't) and look for a trapdoor thing, interact with it to go to the next level. Enemies and crates give gold,
which you can use to buy upgrades from the upgrade menu in the main menu (get explosive bullets, they're neat). By the way, you
can always pause and quit - your health and level number will be saved, but the level will be generated anew; you can use this
to check out both bosses in the same run. If you beat the boss and exit level 5, you win and can start a new run.

#### Why is it good enough
I believe this is distinct from GD50's games because i'm pretty sure there were no:
- first person shooters (the portal thing doesn't qualify as a game)
- roguelites (some can technically kinda count but ehh)
- any save systems
- bosses
- minimaps
It has all the basic functionality of course's games, like health and enemies and menus and pause and stuff plus
extra things mentioned before, and it has 5 scenes (3-5 states depending on how you count), so it's complex enough.

#### Why is it like this
You may notice that the code style and tools used are inconsistent. This is because i started working on this project
several years ago (end of 2018 i think), when i was doing this same course (so it's legal) but unofficially, as part of a class.
Thoughout the years i have made several attempts of varying success to polish/refactor/update Cube Game until i decided to get my 
GD50 certificate, so i made this thing playable for such an occasion. IIRC the first version had 8 levels with no bosses, ranged
enemies and upgrades, and was way buggier. It's also a little different from what's in the video because i made some last minute 
changes, minor enough to not record and edit a new video.
